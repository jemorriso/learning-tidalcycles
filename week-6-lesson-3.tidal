-- i think i'm failing to understand something here, in the video he has an actual midi cable plugged into his synth and interface, while I just have a midi controller
-- i thought it might work to route sound to ableton 'through the controller' but it's not working
d1 $ n "0 7 12" # sound "launchkey"

-- update: it works with ableton (no launchkey)!!!! 🙏🙏🙏
d1 $ n "0 7 12" # sound "tidal1"

d1 $ n "0 7 12" # sound "cpu"

hush
